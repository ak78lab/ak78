# Quantum Principles Behind AK78

This section explains the scientific inspirations for the AK78 Management Platform.

## Core Concepts:
- **Superposition Management**: multiple possible states are evaluated before selection
- **Wavefunction Collapse Protection**: safeguards against premature decision locking
- **Entropy Optimization**: balancing chaos and structure
- **Quantum AI Error Correction**: learning from micro-errors in real-time

The platform applies these ideas metaphorically and structurally to management systems.
