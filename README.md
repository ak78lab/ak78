# AK78 Core

AK78 Core is a quantum-inspired engine for adaptive management in high-uncertainty environments — the foundation of the AK78 Ecosystem.

## 🚀 Vision

We are building a new class of intelligent systems based on principles drawn from quantum mechanics - not for physical computations, but for rethinking how we adapt, decide, and organize in volatile conditions.

This platform serves as the core engine of the AK78 concept: a framework for decision-making under uncertainty using ideas like entropy optimization, wavefunction collapse protection, and superposition-based scenario evaluation.

## 🔍 Key Concepts

- **Superposition Management** - hold multiple potential outcomes before collapsing into action.
- **Entropy Optimization** - detect and regulate disorder or ambiguity in systems.
- **Wavefunction Collapse Protection** - resist premature decisions; wait until clarity outweighs noise.
- **Quantum AI Error Correction** - self-correcting mechanisms inspired by quantum error correction logic.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Classical project management tools break down in chaotic environments.

AK78 introduces a self-adaptive logic that treats uncertainty as a feature, not a bug - allowing for smarter pivots, scenario handling, and intelligent pattern recognition.
