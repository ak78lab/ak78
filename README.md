# AK78 Core Platform

**Quantum-Inspired Adaptive Management for Uncertainty**

AK78 Core is the foundation of a next-generation adaptive management platform designed for high uncertainty, instability, and complexity. It integrates principles from quantum physics, intelligent systems, and strategic design to create a self-evolving architecture capable of learning, correcting, and navigating uncertainty.

## üî≠ Mission

To build a new class of intelligent management systems that:
- Leverage **superposition, wavefunction collapse control, entropy optimization, and quantum error protection**.
- Implement a **self-adaptive control layer (Intellectual Adaptation Layer)**.
- Empower leaders and teams to act with clarity in environments of volatility and change.
