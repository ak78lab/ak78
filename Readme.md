# AK78 Core Platform

Welcome to the AK78 Core Platform - a quantum-inspired adaptive management engine designed for high-uncertainty environments.

## 🚀 Vision

We are building a new class of intelligent systems based on principles drawn from quantum mechanics - not for physical computations, but for rethinking how we adapt, decide, and organize in volatile conditions.

This platform serves as the core engine of the AK78 Management concept: a framework for decision-making under uncertainty using ideas like entropy optimization, wavefunction collapse protection, and superposition-based scenario evaluation.

## 🔍 Key Concepts

- **Superposition Management** - hold multiple possible plans or states before committing to one.
- **Entropy Optimization** - detect and regulate disorder or ambiguity in systems.
- **Wavefunction Collapse Protection** - avoid premature decisions before enough information is available.
- **Quantum AI Error Correction** - self-correcting mechanisms inspired by quantum error correction logic.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Classical project management tools break down in chaotic environments.

AK78 introduces a self-adaptive logic that treats uncertainty as a feature, not a bug - allowing for smarter pivots, scenario handling, and intelligent pattern recognition.
