# Entropy Optimizer Logic

This module is designed to detect, analyze, and manage informational entropy in decision-making environments.

## Goals:
- Measure entropy levels in real-time
- Suggest reorganization of tasks or data
- Visualize complexity patterns

Inspired by quantum entropy and informational theory.
